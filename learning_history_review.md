## **"Reviewing my Learning History"**



1. Procrastination, time management and I'm not a morning person.



2. I have planned things out in advance, make a list of what I have to do or achieve everyday and try to go to bed early.



3. Interaction between professors and students. Constant check-ins. Motivated and positive study environment. 


4. .......



5. Not to be able to master the materials



6. Yes and No since web development is a completely new field for me. I'm excited as much as nervous. However, I will it it my best shot.
